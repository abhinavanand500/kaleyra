# URL_SHORTENER (Seletected in this Hackathon)

Developed a  web-app project which will convert your long URL into small URL. Many a time we are not able to send long URL in normal text messages due to word limitation in mobile phones. So I have developed an website where end user can enter their long URL and get short URL for that website.
This project will create a specific unique URL for each long URL, so if anyone else try to make short URL for same long URL then they will get same short URL.


## Steps

1. Clone this repository to your local.

2. Open the project in an editor of your preference.

3. Use the package [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependencies.

    ```bash
      pip install django
    ```
4. Run your server

   ```bash
      python manage.py runserver 
    ```
   or, the below command if your default python version is python2 use [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

    ```bash
      python3 manage.py runserver 
    ```

5. Your server should be up and running now.
